number = 5 
while number < 50:
     if number % 5 == 0:
          print("Divisible by 5")
     else:
      print("Not divisible by 5")
for x in range(10, 15, 5):
       number = x


#What is the output of this program ?

number take 5(integer) as value
then we create a loop through all numbers from 5 to 50(not included)
with the condition that if the number is divisible by 5 print it on screen
and if not print that it's not, finally we iterate through numbers 10 to 15, by 5 and hold inside the variable number new value from x

Finally : this program produces an infinite loop which will print Divisible by 5 until your computer crashes or you stop the program
