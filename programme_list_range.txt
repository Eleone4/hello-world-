Fill in this code for a program that loops through the numbers between 1 and 40. If a number is divisible by 3, print Hip. If the number is divisible by 7, print Hooray. Remember that there may be numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 7, so you'll have to print both messages for those.

for number in range(1,41):
  if number % 3 == 0 :
     print("Hip") 
  if number % 7 == 0 :
     print("Hooray")
