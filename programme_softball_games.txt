Over the course of 5 games, a softball player scores 5,7,3,1, and 4 runs. What is her average runs per game?

def calculate_average(runs, games):

   sum_of_runs = 0
   for runs in runs_list:
     sum_of_runs += runs
   avg = sum_of_runs / num_games 

   return avg 

  runs_list = [5, 7, 3, 1, 4]
  num_games = len(runs_list)


  print(calculate_average(runs_list, num_games))
